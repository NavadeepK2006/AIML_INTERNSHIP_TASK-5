Task 5 - Decision Trees and Random Forests (Heart Disease Prediction)

Overview: This task focuses on implementing and understanding Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers using the Heart Disease dataset.

Objectives Covered:
Trained a Decision Tree Classifier and visualized it using `plot_tree`.
Analyzed overfitting using different tree depths.
Trained a Random Forest model and compared its performance.
Interpreted feature importances using Random Forest.
Evaluated both models using 5-fold Cross-Validation.

Libraries Used:
scikit-learn
pandas, numpy
matplotlib, seaborn
